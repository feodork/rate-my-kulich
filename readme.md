# Rate My Kulich
A Kulich (plural Kulichi) is an elaborately decorated Russian Easter bread. This app has been designed for users to post their creations to be rated. Loosely inspired by the now defunct [ratemypoo.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20220101080721/https://www.ratemypoo.com/).
You can [check out my app](https://rate-my-kulich.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.

## Technologies Used
This application was built using:
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Node.js
- Express/EJS
- JS
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Approach
I used a [wireframe](https://balsamiq.cloud/solja5p/pgjz2tz) to map out each page of my app (final app has been altered to better suit the purpose of the app). 
The app is built around two main databases: Users & Kulichi.
Users are able to: post, edit, delete & rate kulichi. 

## Future Iterations
- Able to update profile image 
- Update to styling
